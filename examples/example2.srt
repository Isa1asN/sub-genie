00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,160
Developed at Facebook and released in 2013,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,080
it's safe to say React has been the most influential UI library of recent memory.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,560
We use it to build components that represent logical, reusable parts of the UI.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,760
The beauty of React is that the simplicity of building a component

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,000
has been brought down to its theoretical minimum.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,839
It's just a JavaScript function.

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,160
It's so easy, a caveman could do it.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,359
The return value from this function is your HTML or UI,

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,160
which is written in a special syntax called JSX,

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,520
allowing you to easily combine JavaScript with HTML markup.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
If you want to pass data into a component,

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,119
you simply pass at a props argument,

14
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,039
which you can then reference inside the function body or in the UI using braces.

15
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,960
If the value changes, React will react to update the UI.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,439
If we want to give our component its own internal state,

17
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,719
we can use the state hook.

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,439
The hook is just a function that returns a value,

19
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,600
as well as a function to change the value.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
In this case, count is our reactive state,

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,920
and set count will change the state.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,119
When used in the template, the count will always show the most recent value.

23
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:03,439
Then we can bind set count to a button click event,

24
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,200
so the user can change the state.

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,799
React provides a variety of other built-in hooks to handle common use cases,

26
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,840
but the main reason you might want to use React is not the library itself,

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,079
but the massive ecosystem that surrounds it.

28
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,000
React itself doesn't care about routing,

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,480
state management, animation, or anything like that.

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,239
Instead, it lets those concerns evolve naturally within the open source community.

31
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,439
No matter what you're trying to do,

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,560
there's very likely a good supporting library to help you get it done.

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
Need a static site? You have Gatsby.

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,239
Need server-side rendering? You have next.

35
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,680
For animation, you have Spring.

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,959
For forums, you have Formic.

37
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,799
State management, you've got Redux, MobX, Flex, recoil, X state, and more.

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,079
You have an endless supply of choices to get things done the way you like it.

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,079
As an added bonus, once you have React down,

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,120
you can easily jump into React Native and start building mobile apps.

41
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,760
And it's no surprise that knowing this little UI library

42
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,719
is one of the most in-demand skills for front-end developers today.

43
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,719
This has been React in 100 seconds.

44
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,400
